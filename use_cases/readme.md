# Human Mobility Data Use Case Collection

Use cases that human mobility data is needed for in the urban setting, as described in [this](https://alexandrakapp.blog/2021/12/21/use-cases-based-on-human-mobility-data-part-1-urban-and-traffic-planning/) blog article. This is intended as a continuously growing collection.

## Urban and Traffic Planning

| public transport | Demand-driven short- and long-term public transport offer. Based on historic and real-time data, public transport can be optimized to fit daily routines, to account for special events (e.g., soccer games), or to satisfy real-time demands.

| shared mobility | City administrations use  reports on usage behavior and analysis tools to evaluate the use of  micro-mobility in their cities. The mobility data specification has been  established as a standard that more and more mobility service providers start  to use and offer their data accordingly. The specification goes beyond human  mobility data (e.g., charging status of vehicles or definition of prohibited  parking zones, see [this  article](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/whats-possible-with-mds/) and  [this MDS use case  gallery](https://airtable.com/shrPf4QvORkjZmHIs/tblzFfU6fxQm5Sdhm)) but also  includes start and end locations of rentals. | Service providers that combine  data from multiple providers and offer analysis platforms to cities. E.g.,  [Vianova](https://de.vianova.io/) [Remix](https://de.remix.com/),  [Populus](https://www.populus.ai/). |
| electric vehicle infrastructure | City administrations can use mobility data of combustion engine cars to assess where charging infrastructure for electric vehicles may be needed. Operators of buildings and districts need it to plan local charging infrastructure. Operators of electric power systems (mostly distribution system operators) can use mobility data to assess the demand for e-mobility and plan their grids to handle the future demands. | [Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Simulator (ELVIS)](https://github.com/dailab/elvis), [Localiser: commercial software](https://www.localiser.de/)|
